## 3: Simple linear constraints

Solve x + y = 12 and x - y >= 4 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12]

### Output

```
Finding solutions to x + y = 12 and x - y >= 4
Solution 1: x=12, y=0
  x + y = 12 (should be 12)
  x - y = 12 (should be >= 4)
Solution 2: x=11, y=1
  x + y = 12 (should be 12)
  x - y = 10 (should be >= 4)
Solution 3: x=8, y=4
  x + y = 12 (should be 12)
  x - y = 4 (should be >= 4)
Solution 4: x=10, y=2
  x + y = 12 (should be 12)
  x - y = 8 (should be >= 4)
Solution 5: x=9, y=3
  x + y = 12 (should be 12)
  x - y = 6 (should be >= 4)
No more solutions exist.
