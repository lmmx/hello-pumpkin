## 6: Global AllDifferent constraint

Solve x + y + z = 4 with x, y, z taking distinct values each in [0, 4]

### Output

```
Finding solutions where x, y, z are all different and x + y + z = 4
with x, y, z each in [0, 4]
Solution 1: x=3, y=1, z=0
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
Solution 2: x=3, y=0, z=1
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
Solution 3: x=1, y=0, z=3
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
Solution 4: x=0, y=3, z=1
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
Solution 5: x=1, y=3, z=0
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
Solution 6: x=0, y=1, z=3
  x + y + z = 4 (should be 4)
  All different? true
No more solutions exist.
