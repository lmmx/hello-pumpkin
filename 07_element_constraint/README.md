## 7: Element Constraint

Demonstrates the use of the element constraint, which allows for array indexing in constraints. The problem finds an index and result such that `array[index] = result`, where the array is `[5, 8, 3, 7, 2]` and the result must be greater than 5.

### Output

```
Demonstrating the element constraint
Finding index and result such that array[index] = result
Given array = [5, 8, 3, 7, 2]

Found a solution:
  index = 1
  result = 8
  Verification: array[1] = 8 (should be 8)
  Constraint: result > 5 => 8 > 5: true
```
