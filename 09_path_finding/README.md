## 9: Path Finding in a Graph

Demonstrates how to use Pumpkin solver for a simple path finding problem in a graph. The problem involves finding a path from node 0 to node 4 with length <= 3 in a small graph.

### Output

```
Simple path finding in a graph
Finding a path from node 0 to node 4 with length <= 3

Found a path from node 0 to node 4:
Path: [0, 2, 4]
Path length: 2

Verifying that all consecutive nodes in the path are connected:
Edge (0, 2) exists: true
Edge (2, 4) exists: true
```
