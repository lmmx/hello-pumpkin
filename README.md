# Hello Pumpkin

Hello world programs demonstrating how to use the Pumpkin solver

1. `01_simple_linear`: Simple linear constraints. Solve x + y = 12 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12]
2. `02_linear_all_solutions`: Simple linear constraints. Solve x + y = 12 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12], for all (x,y)
