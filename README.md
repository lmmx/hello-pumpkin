# Hello Pumpkin

Hello world programs demonstrating how to use the Pumpkin solver

1. `01_simple_linear`: Simple linear constraints. Solve x + y = 12 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12]
2. `02_linear_all_solutions`: Simple linear constraints. Solve x + y = 12 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12], for all (x,y)
3. `03_linear_multiconstraint`: Solve x + y = 12 and x - y >= 4 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12]
4. `04_optimisation_max`: Solve x + y = 12 for variables (x,y) each in [0,12] to maximise x
5. `05_solve_multiple_domains`: Solve x + y + z = 12 for variables (x,y,z), with x in [0,6], y in [6,12], z in [2,8]
6. `06_solve_global_all_different`: Solve x + y + z = 4 with x, y, z taking distinct values each in [0, 4]
